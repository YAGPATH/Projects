# Specialized Cycle Shop Clone

This GitHub repository contains the final enhanced version of a cycle shop website. Initially developed as a group project with a team of five members during the Construct Week at Masai School,After the conclusion of the group project, this cycle shop website underwent significant enhancements and refinements carried out entirely by me. As the sole contributor, I took the initiative to address issues and implement improvements, resulting in a final version that showcases my individual efforts and skills.

During the enhancement phase, I focused on several key areas. Firstly, I made the website fully responsive to ensure seamless and enjoyable user experiences across a variety of devices and screen sizes. Additionally, I refined the price calculation logic, rectifying any inaccuracies and ensuring accurate pricing information for products.

Furthermore, I worked on resolving issues related to the wishlist page, enhancing its functionality and overall user experience. These improvements, along with various other refinements, have culminated in the final iteration of the cycle shop website, which represents the culmination of my solo efforts.

I am proud to present this enhanced version, which demonstrates my expertise, dedication, and commitment to delivering a polished and high-quality website. By leveraging my skills in web development, I have created a project that is both functional and visually appealing.

## Responsiveness

The Cycle Shop Website is designed to be fully responsive, providing an optimal user experience across various devices and screen sizes. The following measures have been taken to ensure responsiveness:

- Responsive Layout: The website utilizes a responsive layout design, adapting its structure and content dynamically based on the screen size. This allows users to comfortably view and interact with the website on different devices, such as desktop computers, laptops, tablets, and mobile phones.

- Media Queries: Media queries are implemented in the CSS code to apply specific styles and layout adjustments based on the device's screen size. This enables the website to respond and adapt to different breakpoints, providing an optimized view for each device.
- Flexible Images: Images within the website are made responsive using CSS techniques such as max-width: 100% and height: auto. This ensures that images scale proportionally and adjust appropriately within the available space, preventing them from overflowing or becoming distorted on smaller screens.

- Fluid Grid System: The website's layout is designed using a fluid grid system, which allows content to automatically adjust and reflow based on the screen size. This grid system ensures that the website's elements are well-distributed and aligned, regardless of the device's viewport dimensions.

- Touch-Friendly Elements: Interactive elements, such as buttons and navigation menus, are designed with touch-friendly features to accommodate mobile and tablet users. This includes providing sufficient spacing between elements to prevent accidental taps, using appropriate touch events, and ensuring clickable areas are large enough for easy interaction.
